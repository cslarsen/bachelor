To create shared folders on VirtualBox between your guest OS and VM,
follow the instructions from

  http://askubuntu.com/questions/123025/what-is-the-correct-way-to-share-directories-in-mac-and-ubuntu-with-correct-perm

If you can't find mount.vboxsf, try

  sudo find / -name mount.vboxsf

Then use that to complete the instructions.  I had to do this to get the
mininet user to have shared folders with correct permissions (this is
important to, e.g., git):

  /opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-4.3.10/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions/mount.vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0002 bachelor /media/sf_bachelor/

I've tried everything else, and this is the only thing that worked for me!

P.S. If you can't find mount.vboxsf above, you need to put the
VBoxGuestAdditions into the CD-ROM in VirtualBox, then mount it

  mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom

Then you can find the install files in /media/cdrom, just run

  sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

This should work!
