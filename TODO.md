Miscellaneous things to do
==========================

  * Update thesis
    * Show goal of 3-switches, paxos between, show
      how Paxos is on the client on a normal system,
      show that paxos is moved to the switch, controller first and then down
      to flow tables.

Unimportant / Do later
----------------------

  * Format hyperlinks in bibtex to look better?
  * Use another style than plain.bst for bibtex? Find out which style UiS wants.
  * Reference URL from bibtex entry, i.e., instead of
    doing "note = {\url{...}}", do something like "note = {\url{this_entry.url}}"

Done
----

  * Have bibtex use hyperlinks, see e.g.
