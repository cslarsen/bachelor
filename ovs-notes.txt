Here are some notes on coding against Open vSwitch.

- Compiling Open vSwitch, see thesis notes.
  Was really no problem. The codebase is really clean and it seems they've
  spent a lot of time making a really source distribution.

- Using the logger

  #include "vlog.h"
  VLOG_FATAL("bla bla %s", ovs_strerror(errno));

- I'm working on origin/branch-2.1.
  There is a newer one in HEAD, but I want to code against a stable version.

- Here are dev notes from ovs:
  http://openvswitch.org/development/

- Some personal dev notes from a guy:
  https://github.com/ljakab/openvswitch/wiki/Development-notes

- The wiki pages contain useful info
  https://github.com/ljakab/openvswitch/wiki/_pages

- Placed where openflow may be implemented:

  $ grep -RI openflow\\.h * | grep \\.c | cut -f1 -d: | sort | uniq
