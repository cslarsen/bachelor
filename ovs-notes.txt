Here are some notes on coding against Open vSwitch.

- Compiling Open vSwitch, see thesis notes.
  Was really no problem. The codebase is really clean and it seems they've
  spent a lot of time making a really source distribution.

- Using the logger

  #include "vlog.h"
  VLOG_FATAL("bla bla %s", ovs_strerror(errno));
