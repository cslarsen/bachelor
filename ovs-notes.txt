Here are some notes on coding against Open vSwitch.

- Compiling Open vSwitch, see thesis notes.
  Was really no problem. The codebase is really clean and it seems they've
  spent a lot of time making a really source distribution.

- Using the logger

  #include "vlog.h"
  VLOG_FATAL("bla bla %s", ovs_strerror(errno));

- I'm working on origin/branch-2.1.
  There is a newer one in HEAD, but I want to code against a stable version.

- Here are dev notes from ovs:

- Some personal dev notes from a guy:
