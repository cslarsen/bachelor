Bachelor's Thesis for Christian Stigen Larsen
=============================================

This is a work-in-progress repository for my thesis.

In my thesis, I will investigate how we can build a Paxos-enabled software
designed network (SDN) using OpenFlow.

The major goal is to create a network that uses Paxos to ensure consistency
in the network. We will also look into how we can make this network as
efficient as possible, i.e. how we can reduce the roundtrips taken to the
control plane.
