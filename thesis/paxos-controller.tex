\section{Paxos on the controller}

Our first step will be to implement simple Paxos \cite{Lam01} entirely in a
controller\index{controller}.

The aim is to show that a topology with a Paxos--enabled controller will
satisfy the requirements of Paxos --- i.e.,~that nodes in the network reach
consensus with progress\todo{Skriv om, og sjekk at forklaring p√• reqs er
riktig}.

We will use Mininet\index{Mininet} \cite{Lantz:2010:NLR:1868447.1868466} to
run and simulate the \ac{SDN} and POX\index{POX} \cite{POX.1} for
implementing a Paxos in an OpenFlow controller.  POX is part of the
NOX\index{NOX}--project \cite{Gude:2008:NTO:1384609.1384625}.  They both use
Python\index{Python}\footnote{Mininet uses Python version 2.7.}
\cite{vanRossum:2009:PRM:1610526} as the implementation language, which
means we can share some code between them.  Both projects are mature and
easy to use.  The Mininet simulation itself will run on a virtual machine
using VirtualBox\index{VirtualBox} \cite{Watson:2008:VBB:1344209.1344210}.
