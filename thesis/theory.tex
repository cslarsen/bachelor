\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:background}

In chapter \ref{chapter:introduction} we stated our thesis goal of offering
Paxos at the networking-level and building a distributed replication system
on top of it.
%
Here, we will present the various technologies we will use to implement such
a system.

\section{OpenFlow}
\label{chapter:openflow.background}

As mentioned in chapter \ref{chapter:introduction}, the core idea of
\acs{SDN} is to dissociate the controller from the switch, enabling software
developers to ``program the network''.  This is illustrated in figure
\vref{figure:decoupling.planes}.

OpenFlow \cite{McKeown:2008:OEI:1355734.1355746,openflow-1.0} is one of
several ways to enable \acf{SDN}
%
It is a specification of a messaging protocol for the interaction between
a switch and controller, detailing what kind of actions that can be
performed by each of these components.
%
Examples of \ac{SDN} solutions predating OpenFlow are SANE
\cite{Casado:2006:SPA:1267336.1267346}, Ethane
\cite{Casado:2007:ETC:1282427.1282382}, 4D
\cite{Greenberg:2005:CSA:1096536.1096541}.

In OpenFlow, the controller is a piece of software can inspect packets and
send commands down to the switch.  It can instruct the switch perform actions like
forwarding a packet to an output port going to another switch, changing
header fields, drop it and so on.
%
Additionally, the switch can be set up to perform such actions by itself,
using a \textit{flow table}.  This is what we have previously referred to as
the \textit{forwarding plane}, and as highly performant in comparison to
handling each individual packet in the controller.

OpenFlow controllers can be written in any programming language that offers
an OpenFlow framework.  While the OpenFlow switches are usually also
implemented in software, several vendors now ship hardware switches that
support the OpenFlow protocol.

\subsection{The Flow Table}
\label{chapter:theory.flow.table}

The aforementioned flow table consists of several flow
entries---colloquially called \textit{flows}.
%
These contain rules for matching packets and actions to perform when there
is a match.
%
In addition there are several counters used for collecting various
statistical metrics (e.g., how many times a flow has been executed) and
timeouts that dictate how long an entry will exist in the table.

        $S$ and $C$, making it possible to implement $C$ in software on an
        ordinary computer. The connection between $S$ and $C$ is encrypted.}

When a switch receives a packet, it will try to match it with entries in
the flow table (table \vref{openflow.flow.entry.spec}).
%
Each flow entry---or \textit{flow}---contains a matching pattern and a set of
actions to perform in the case of a match.  The actions can be to rewrite
a header field, forward the packet to a port, drop it and so on.
%
If a packet does not match any flows, the switch will forward a buffer ID
and packet headers to the controller $C_1$ on a secure channel.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline \textbf{Header fields} &
           \textbf{Counters} &
           \textbf{Actions} \\
    \hline \dots & \dots & \dots \\
  \end{tabular}

  \caption{The OpenFlow 1.0 flow table.}
  \label{openflow.flow.entry.spec}
\end{table}

The controller can then decide what to do with the packet.  Using the
OpenFlow protocol, it can issue immediate actions to the switch or install
flows, so the switch can operate on its own.

The flow tables are initially empty, meaning that all packets are by default
sent to the controller.  During this phase, the controller will
explicitly handle every packet.  At the same time, it will incrementally
build up an internal map of the network.  As the map forms, it can start
installing flows in the switch.

For instance, if a controller learns the port numbers for a pair of
addresses, it can instruct the switch to automatically forward packets to
the appropriate ports when the two are involved.  If the ports are unknown,
it can broadcast the packet on all ports, knowing that only designated
receivers will act on them.
%
What we have described here is a \textit{learning switch}.  It is explained
in detail in chapter \vref{chapter:l2.learning.switch}.

Along with each flow entry is an associated set of timeouts.  Flows are
removed from the flow table when they time out.
%
This serves several purposes.  First of all, it makes sure that flow tables
do not fill up quickly.  Secondly, because flows---and packets---are
transient by nature, controllers will be given the chance to update rules
based on changes in the network.
%
Finally, this mode of operation adheres to the principle of autonomous
operation\index{autonomous operation} commonly seen in networking devices.
%
Properly designed controllers should not need elaborate configuration to
work.  While they initially do all the heavy-lifting, they can offload work
to the switches, who can then dispatch packets very quickly.

\subsection{OpenFlow Applications}

OpenFlow has been used for many purposes.  E.g., researchers at Stanford
build an OpenFlow network that was able to migrate a virtual video game
server \ac{VM} from California to Japan---while it was running, without
interruption, using the \textit{same} IP-address
\cite{erickson2008demonstration} \cite{kobayashi2013maturing}.
%
The campus network on Stanford in fact uses a lot of OpenFlow devices.
Google also uses it in production in their global network.

Although invented quite recently, software-defined networking is already
heavily used both in academia and industry.  Google, for instance, are using
OpenFlow to ease deployment and increase utilization in their backbone
networks \cite{crabbe2012sdn} and Stanford has deployed several
OpenFlow-controlled networks on their university network.

Since version 1.0 of the OpenFlow specification\index{OpenFlow!versions} was
released in 2009 there have been several point releases and errata.  The
most recent one as of 2014 is 1.4\index{OpenFlow!versions}
\cite{openflow-1.0,openflow-1.0.1,openflow-1.0.2,openflow-1.1,openflow-1.2,openflow-1.3,openflow-1.4}.

\section{Paxos}
\label{chapter:background.paxos}

Paxos is a distributed consensus algorithm.
\todo{Expand introduction and details}

Even though the basic Paxos algorithm is conceptually quite simple
\cite{Lam01}, it can be challenging to implement properly
\cite{Chandra:2007:PML:1281100.1281103}.

We chose to use OpenFlow as the basis for our system.
We could just as well have used a networking system that already supported
programmability in some way, for instance the Intel DPDK\todo{Needs
