\label{chapter:design}

In this chapter, we will establish a solid design for our solution.

We will start by presenting a network topology for a replicated system using
Paxos on the switch.  After that, we will look at what OpenFlow can offer us
to implement our system, then design a system of flows that will provide a
replication system using Paxos.
