I would like to thank my thesis advisor Hein Meling for his close
collaboration, guidance, patience and insightful comments throughout this
work.

Hein had the original idea of putting Paxos on the switch-level, and I thank
him for letting me work on turning it into an implementation.

Multi-Paxos would not have made it into the implementation without the
helpful tutoring given by doctoral student Tormod Erevik Lea.

During my modifications of Open vSwitch, I received many helpful advice from
its community.

Finally, none of this would be possible without my amazing fiancée Siri.
%
While I spent my days at work and University, she had the overwhelming
pleasure of taking care of our two lovely children, Mari and Bjørn.
Thank you for letting me achieve a long-sought dream, and I dedicate this
thesis to you.
