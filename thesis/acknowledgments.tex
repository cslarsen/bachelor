I would like to thank my thesis advisor Hein Meling for his close
collaboration, guidance, patience and insightful comments throughout this
work.

Hein had the original idea of putting Paxos on the switch-level, and I thank
him for letting me work on turning it into an implementation.

Multi-Paxos would not have made it into the implementation without the
helpful tutoring given by doctoral student Tormod Erevik Lea.

While modifying Open vSwitch I received friendly and useful hints on the
project mailing lists.

Finally, none of this would be possible without my amazing fiancée Siri, who
has taken care of our beautiful children Mari and Bjørn while I spent my
days at work and University.  Thank you for letting me achieve my dream.
