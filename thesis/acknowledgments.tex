I would like to thank my thesis advisor Hein Meling for his close
collaboration, guidance, patience and insightful comments throughout this
work.

Hein approached me with the fascinating idea of putting Paxos in the
switch, and I thank him not only for letting me explore this problem, but
also for getting me hooked on software-defined networking.

Multi-Paxos would not have made it into the implementation without the
clear tutorial given by doctoral student Tormod Erevik Lea.

During my modifications of Open vSwitch, I received helpful advice from
its friendly community on the project mailing list.

Finally, none of this would be possible without my amazing fiancée Siri.

While I spent my days at work and University, she had the overwhelming
pleasure of taking care of our two lovely children, Mari and Bjørn.

Thank you for helping me achieve a long-sought dream: I dedicate this
thesis to you.
