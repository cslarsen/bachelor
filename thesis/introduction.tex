\chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{\acf{SDN}} \cite{Casado:2005:VNS:1047344.1047383} emerged from
research at Berkeley and Stanford around 2008 as a way to enable networks to
be defined and managed using software.

The central idea was to split the {\em control} and {\em data}
planes\footnote{Also called the {\em routing control} and {\em forwarding}
planes, respectively.}.
%
While routers traditionally contained both in hardware, one would now move
the controller out to an external device---e.g.~as a software component
running on a server.  The two would then communicate over a secure network
channel, using a predetermined protocol.

One such protocol is {\em OpenFlow}\index{OpenFlow}\footnote{Other
\ac{SDN} solutions predating OpenFlow are SANE
\cite{Casado:2006:SPA:1267336.1267346}, Ethane
\cite{Casado:2007:ETC:1282427.1282382}, 4D
\cite{Greenberg:2005:CSA:1096536.1096541}, etc.}
\cite{McKeown:2008:OEI:1355734.1355746}. 
In OpenFlow, the controller configures so--called {\em flow tables}\index{flow table} in the
data plane \index{data plane} which contain matching patterns and actions
for incoming packets.  These tables are designed for high performance
and are thus quite simple.  On the other hand, the controller can be
arbitrarily complex.

Although invented quite recently, software--defined networking is already
heavily used both in academia and industry.  Google, for instance, are using
OpenFlow to ease deploymend and increase utilization in their backbone
networks \cite{crabbe2012sdn} and Stanford has deployed several
OpenFlow--controlled networks on their university network.

\textbf{Paxos}\index{Paxos} \cite{Lamport:1998:PP:279227.279229} is a
family of distributed, fault--tolerant consensus algorithms.  It allows
network nodes to reach {\em agreement} even in the face of intermittent
network failures.  For example, one can design a database system using Paxos
to make sure that transactions are executed in the same order on all nodes.

Originally published by Leslie Lamport\index{Lamport, Leslie} in 1989, Paxos
has spawned numerous extensions like Byzantine tolerance and so on.

\textbf{Our aim} is to build an efficient, {\em Paxos--enabled software defined
network} where nodes are able to leverage the guarantees of Paxos without
needing to handle the details.

For simplicity, we will constrain our scope to Paxos {\em phase two} where
we have steady--state flow with no failures.

We will implement this in progressive stages:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stage 1: Implement Paxos entirely on the controller.
\item Stage 2: Move parts of Paxos down from the controllers to the
switches.
\item Stage 3: Look for possible expansion of the OpenFlow protocol to
facilitate running Paxos on the switches.
\end{itemize}

Stage 1 should be the easiest to implement, and will be used as a baseline
for comparing networking performance with later stages.

Additionally, we will implement Paxos entirely on the network nodes, using
the same topology, to get an idea of how much of a performance hit we take
for running it on the controller.

In stage 2, we will look at how we can improve efficiency by moving parts of
the algorithm down into the switches using the flow tables.

Finally, in stage 3 we will investigate whether it would make sense to
enhance the OpenFlow protocol with new primitives to build fast
networking services such as Paxos.

{\em 
  Our hypothesis is that by moving parts of the Paxos implementation down to
  the switches, we will get a more performant system than by running Paxos
  either on the controller or on the network nodes.
}

The thesis will therefore be a study of {\em feasibility}.

\section{Scope}

\todo{Skriv mere og bedre}

We will only look at a simplified version of Paxos in which we only
implement accept and learn messages. We ignore liveness checking such as
heartbeats. We ignore implementing the expanded OpenFlow features in the
network protocol and controller. We only look at steady state Paxos.
We assume switches are colocated. etc etc etc.

We also ignore the fact that if a switch goes down and back up again, it
will need to rejoin the Paxos network and its end--hosts need to synchronize
state (or just copy the state from a host on another switch).

\section{Topology}

Here we present what we want to achieve.  First, let's look at the situation
for one switch.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, circle}]
    \node (c1)    at (-2,  3) {$c_1$};
    \node (ctrl1) at ( 0,  2) {$T_1$};
    \node (S1)    at ( 0,  0) {$S_1$};
    \node (h1)    at (-2, -2) {$h_1$};
    \node (h2)    at ( 0, -2) {$h_2$};
    \node (h3)    at ( 2, -2) {$h_3$};

    \draw (c1) to[out=315,in=135] (S1);
    \draw (S1) -- (ctrl1);
    \draw (S1) -- (h1);
    \draw (S1) -- (h2);
    \draw (S1) -- (h3);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A single switch $S_1$ with its controller $T_1$, end--hosts
    $h_1, h_2, h_3$ and one WAN--side client $c_1$.}
  \label{figure:graph.single.switch}
\end{figure}

For an explanation of our nomenclature, we will always talk about
\textit{clients} as being remote hosts on the \ac{WAN} side.

The clients are supposed to be placed on the \ac{WAN}---but they are actually
just ordinary hosts on each switch.  We just \textit{pretend} they are
placed on the WAN.  It really doesn't matter, though, as all of their
communication goes through each respective switch.

The \textit{end--hosts} are nodes connected to a single switch and running
services such as key--value stores, lock servers, logging servers,
databases, and so on.

Here is the situation with three switches---the minimum number nodes we need
in a Paxos system.  We have added all--to--all links between the switches in
case any one of them should go down.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, circle},x=0.75cm,y=0.75cm]
    \foreach \n in {1,2,3} {
      \pgfmathsetmacro\x{(\n-2)*6}
      \node (c\n)    at (\x - 2,  4) {$c_\n$};
      \node (ctrl\n) at (\x ,  2) {$T_\n$};
      \node (S\n)    at (\x ,  0) {$S_\n$};

      \draw (c\n) to[out=315,in=135] (S\n);
      \draw (S\n) -- (ctrl\n);

      \foreach \h in {1,2,3} {
        \pgfmathsetmacro\pos{(\h - 2)*2}
        \pgfmathtruncatemacro\num{((\n - 1)*3) + int(\h)}
        \node (h\num) at (\x + \pos, -2) {$h_{\num}$};
        \draw (S\n) -- (h\num);
      }

    }

    % Links between switches
    \draw (S1) to[out=-10,in=190] (S2);
    \draw (S2) to[out=-10,in=190] (S3);
    \draw (S1) to[out=-15,in=195] (S3);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Three switches $S_1, S_2, S_3$ with controllers $T_1, T_2, T_3$ acting as Paxos nodes.}
  \label{figure:graph.three.switches}
\end{figure}

The point is that these services will be mirrored by the use of our
Paxos--enabled switches.  For our purposes, we will assume that the services
on these hosts are \textit{deterministic}\footnote{Or, more correctly,
\textit{referentially transparent}.} in the sense that the parameters
uniquely determine the state of the service after being processed---if two
hosts running the same service receive the exact same packet, their state
will be identical after having processed it.  This is a prerequisite for our
system.  The OpenFlow switches, running Paxos, will only make sure that
packets are delivered in the \textit{same order} to the end--hosts.

\section{Viability}

Why would such a system be useful? Consider the situation of implementing
Paxos in code on some servers, running services such as key--value stores,
etc.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, circle},x=0.75cm,y=0.75cm]

    % For each switch ...
    \foreach \n in {1,2,3} {
      \pgfmathsetmacro\x{(\n-2)*6}
      \node (ctrl\n) at (\x ,  2) {$T_\n$};
      \node (S\n)    at (\x ,  0) {$S_\n$};

      \draw (S\n) -- (ctrl\n);

      % For each host ...
      \foreach \h in {1,2,3} {
        \pgfmathsetmacro\pos{(\h - 2)*2}
        \pgfmathtruncatemacro\num{((\n - 1)*3) + int(\h)}

        % Host node
        \node (h\num) at (\x + \pos, -2) {$h_{\num}$};
        \draw (S\n) -- (h\num);

        % Paxos node
        \node [very thick] (P\num) at (\x + \pos, -3.75) {$P$};
        \draw [dashed] (h\num) -- (P\num);
      }
    }

    % Links between switches
    \draw (S1) to[out=-10,in=190] (S2);
    \draw (S2) to[out=-10,in=190] (S3);
    \draw (S1) to[out=-15,in=195] (S3);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Support for Paxos on the servers $h_1, \dots, h_3$ requires a
    copy of the Paxos code $P$ on each server.}
  \label{figure:paxos.on.servers}
\end{figure}

Here, each server needs to have an implementation of Paxos in code (shown as $P$
in figure \ref{figure:paxos.on.servers}).
It means the software developer has to specifically add support
for Paxos when designing the server code, tailoring it for the
particular service.  All Paxos handling must be done
at a high networking layer---most likely in the application layer at the
very top.

Now consider the situation where the switch provides Paxos capabilities
(figure \ref{figure:paxos.on.switches}).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw, circle},x=0.75cm,y=0.75cm]

    % For each switch ...
    \foreach \n in {1,2,3} {
      \pgfmathsetmacro\x{(\n-2)*6}
      \node (ctrl\n) at (\x ,  2) {$T_\n$};
      \node (S\n)    at (\x ,  0) {$S_\n$};

      \draw (S\n) -- (ctrl\n);

      % Paxos node
      \node [very thick] (P\n) at (\x + 2, 1) {$P$};
      \draw [dashed] (S\n) -- (P\n);
      \draw [dashed] (ctrl\n) -- (P\n);

      % For each host ...
      \foreach \h in {1,2,3} {
        \pgfmathsetmacro\pos{(\h - 2)*2}
        \pgfmathtruncatemacro\num{((\n - 1)*3) + int(\h)}

        % Host node
        \node (h\num) at (\x + \pos, -2) {$h_{\num}$};
        \draw (S\n) -- (h\num);
      }
    }

    % Links between switches
    \draw (S1) to[out=-10,in=190] (S2);
    \draw (S2) to[out=-10,in=190] (S3);
    \draw (S1) to[out=-15,in=195] (S3);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Paxos ($P$) on the switches $S_1, S_2, S_3$ mitigates the need for special code on the servers.}
  \label{figure:paxos.on.switches}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{figure:paxos.on.switches}, the switches themselves (and their
controllers) enable
support for Paxos\footnote{We have moved the servers to several switches
to indicate a distributed nature between the switches.
Paxos on a single switch would not be very useful, as that would be a single
point of failure and---after all---be the sole decision point for message
ordering.}.
This should let the servers be oblivious of the fact that Paxos is used to
enable ordering of packet arrival to them.

Besides, Paxos is now run at a much lower networking level and at the point
where switching is done---there will be less hops for each packet.

Of course, there are pros and cons for each scenario.
When implementing Paxos, one can often take advantage of
the particular way each server operates. Sometimes one actually
\textit{needs} to know this to implement Paxos.  Therefore, an
implementation of Paxos in each server's code base would be beneficial.

On the other hand, in our scenario, we can potentially add support for
message ordering through Paxos on servers that does not already support it.
The kinds of services that this would work on is for systems that are
deterministic in nature: The same input (or client packet) on any server
would produce the same internal state and output.
%
But there is a big class of software that has this behaviour:  Key--value
stores, logging servers, relational databases and so on\footnote{But not
lock servers, because a lock can only be held by one server at a time.}

The only thing our model does not cover is the situation where a switch goes
completely down.  In that case, each connected server should start
synchronizing their internal state with any of the others that have been up.

All in all, we believe this is a viable experiment with practical benefits.
Indeed, using a software--based approach for switches lets us test our model
on \textit{any} existing piece of server software.

Moreover, we also intend to show how one can optimize the performance of
this model further, by moving parts of the Paxos implementation down into
the switches' flow tables.  This should have a big impact, because Paxos
handling is done at a lower level and closer to the central network
components than what would be the case with Paxos in the server code base.
