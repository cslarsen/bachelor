\subsection{Full Paxos}

The Paxos\index{Paxos} papers by Lamport \cite{Lamport:1998:PP:279227.279229,Lam01}
do not describe a specific implementation algorithm.
Details such as liveness\index{liveness} checking, message structures and so on have
been omitted because they are irrelevant to the algorithm at large and may be
different from each implementation.  Even though Paxos
is conceptually simple, it has been shown to be non-trivial to implement
correctly \cite{Chandra:2007:PML:1281100.1281103}.

Our implementation has therefore been based 
\cite{Insane.Paxos}, which in turn is a condensed form of the ones given in 
\cite{renesse.paxos,Lam01}.
%
Algorithms \ref{algorithm:paxos.full.proposer} and
\ref{algorithm:paxos.full.acceptor} implement full, non-Byzantine Paxos.
We will simplify these later on.  These algorithms do not perform \textit{leader
election}.

        \EndIf
      \EndIf
    \EndOn
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm \ref{algorithm:paxos.full.proposer}
\vpageref{algorithm:paxos.full.proposer} is for the \textit{proposer
role}.  \texttt{TRUST} messages are received during phase 1a, and
\texttt{PROMISE}s are received during phase 2a. See \cite{Lam01} for details.

First we initialize the proposer. We assume it already knows (the addresses
of) the acceptors $A$.  The current round number $crnd$ is initialized to
zero, although later we will implement a version that guarantees a sequence
of unique $crnd$s (shown in equations \ref{equation:crnd_i} and
\ref{equation:crnd_mod_N}).

Upon receiving a \texttt{TRUST} message from $\Omega_c$, it will pick the
proposal number larger than $crnd$, reset the set of
$\langle round, vote~value\rangle$ tuples and then send a
\texttt{PREPARE} message to all acceptors $A$.  Finally, it will
send a \texttt{PREPARE} message to all acceptors.
%
The implementation of \textbf{pickNext} is found in
algorithm \ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.pickNext},
\vpageref[below]{ch:simplifying.paxos}.

When it receives a \texttt{PROMISE}, it will first check that it is a reply
that belongs in the current round.  It will store the acceptor's $vrnd$ and
$vval$, then it will check whether it has received accepts from a
\textit{majority} of acceptors.
It will also check that it has not already accepted this message.
If it has, then it will simply resend the \texttt{ACCEPT}ed value.
If it hasn't, it will go on and send the next value from its buffer.
We don't show implementations for \textbf{pickAny} or \textbf{pickLargest},
but one can imagine these are simple queues of messages to process.

Algorithm \ref{algorithm:paxos.full.acceptor}
\vpageref{algorithm:paxos.full.acceptor} is for the \textit{acceptor
role}.  It will act on \texttt{PREPARE} and \texttt{ACCEPT} messages.
When \texttt{PREPARE} is received, it will simply check if the round number
is larger than the highest round it has seen so far.  If so, it will update
its round number $rnd$ and send back a \texttt{PROMISE} to the acceptor.

Upon receiving an \texttt{ACCEPT} message, it will again check if the round
number is equal to or larger than the largest it has already seen, and that
it has not already accepted that value.  If this is the case, it will update
its values and send a \texttt{LEARN} message to \textit{all} learners.

The full Paxos algorithm for the \textit{learner role} has been omitted, but
we will detail one for the simplified version.

\subsection{Simplified Paxos}
\label{ch:simplifying.paxos}

Because this is a feasibility study, and we have limited time, we will only
focus on the most common case of message exchanges in Paxos.
%
This is what \cite{Lam01,Lamport:1998:PP:279227.279229} refer to as
\textit{phase two}, and only involves \textit{accept} and \textit{learn}
messages.
%
Implementing phase one (\textit{prepare} and \textit{promise} messages)
\textit{correctly} is very hard, and we will assume from now on that this
has already taken place.
%
This leads to the simplified version of Paxos that we present here.

Referring to algorithms \ref{algorithm:paxos.full.proposer} and
\ref{algorithm:paxos.full.acceptor} above, we see that we can remove
$vrnd$ altogether.
%
Also, each Paxos node in our system will take on all three roles, so we
don't need separate sets for the acceptors, proposers and learners.
%
We therefore replace the sets $A$, $P$ and $L$ with the single set $N$ to
refer to all Paxos nodes.

While $crnd$ is static for phase two, we will keep it so that future
implementations can more easily extend the solution to support phase one.
%
Instead of initializing it to zero, we will set it to the node's unique
identifier.
%
In $\textbf{pickNext}$ (algorithm \ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.pickNext}) we
will increment $crnd$ with the total number of Paxos nodes, $|N|$.
%
This is a common technique for ensuring that every $crnd$ will be unique,
with the added benefit that we can deduce $node_{id}$ from it (equation
\ref{equation:crnd_i}).

Given
\begin{gather}
  crnd_i = \left\{
             \begin{array}{ll}
               n_{id} & \mbox{for } i = 0 \\
               crnd_{i-1} + |N| & \mbox{for } i \geq 1
             \end{array}
           \right. , n \in N
  \label{equation:crnd_i}
\end{gather}
then, by definition,
\begin{gather}
  n_{id} \equiv crnd\ (\bmod\ |N|)\ \text{for}\ n \in N
  \label{equation:crnd_mod_N}
\end{gather}
\index{$crnd$}

where $n$ is the node and $N$ is the set of all nodes.  This leads to our
definition of $\textbf{pickNext}$ in algorithm
\ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.pickNext}.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Definition of \textbf{pickNext} based on equation \ref{equation:crnd_mod_N}}
  \label{algorithm:paxos.simple.pickNext}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \State $N$ \Comment{The set of all Paxos nodes}
    \State $n_{id} \gets \text{Unique Paxos node id}$
    \State $crnd \gets n_{id}$ \Comment{Replaces initialization of $crnd$ in algorithm \ref{algorithm:paxos.full.proposer}}

    \Function{$\textbf{pickNext}$}{}
      \State $\textbf{return}\ crnd + |N|$ \Comment{Unique per equation \ref{equation:crnd_mod_N}}

\index{Paxos!\textbf{pickNext}}
\index{\textbf{pickNext}}
\index{$n_{id}$}

Equation \ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.pickNext} and algorithm
\ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.pickNext} could also be used to uniquely tag
each incoming client packet with a unique identifier (see section
\ref{chapter:paxos.client.message}).

As we only intend to show that we can implement \texttt{ACCEPT} and
\texttt{LEARN}, we can ignore \texttt{TRUST}, \texttt{PROMISE} and
\texttt{PREPARE} messages.
%
This leaves us with simpler algorithms that should be easier to implement.

        \EndForIn
      \EndIf
    \EndOn

        \State $\textbf{process\_queue}(n, seq)$
      \EndIf
    \EndOn
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\index{Paxos!on learn}
\index{\texttt{LEARN}}

Note that we have introduced a new parameter $seq$ in algorithms
\ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.acceptor} and
\ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.learner}.
This is because we have also incorporated \textit{multi-Paxos slots} \cite{renesse.paxos},
which requires us to store sequence numbers $seq$ as well.
While the Paxos leader decides the order in which messages should be
processed, it is the learner who actually makes sure that they are delivered
in order (algorithm \vref{algorithm:paxos.simple.learner}).

In algorithm \ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.learner}, the
the procedure $\textbf{process\_queue}$ will process the queue in-order of
increasing sequence numbers, starting from the lowest that has not been
processed.  It will process each message (i.e.,~send the stored packet in
$vval$ out to its final destination) until a slot has not been learned
(meaning it has received enough learn-messages for this sequence number in
 this round)  or until there is a gap in the sequence numbers.
If there is a gap, it means that it has received messages in the wrong
order, and it must therefore wait until it has a consecutive sequence of
slots.

The number of required learns is simply $1+\floor*{|N|/2}$, or one more than
(the floor of) half the number of nodes: For three nodes, this number is
two.

      \EndForIn
    \EndOn
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\index{Paxos!on client}
\index{\texttt{CLIENT}}

Finally, we need a way to catch packets from clients that we want to trigger
an \texttt{ACCEPT} for.  Shown in in algorithm
\ref{algorithm:paxos.simple.client}, we do not specify how we identify a
client packet.  In our actual implementation, we deduce which port on the
switch the clients are on by using an L2 Learning Switch
(section \vref{chapter:l2.learning.switch}).
