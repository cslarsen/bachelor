\section{An L2 learning switch in OpenFlow}

When you write an OpenFlow controller, the flow table is empty and all
packets will by default be delivered to the controller.

The controller must then decide what to do with the packets.  If we don't
implement any sort of forwarding behvaiour for the packets, none of the
hosts will be able to communicate.

So our system will need a forwarding mechanism at the bottom of the Paxos
networking capabilities.  The simplest system is just to implement a
\textit{hub}:  For each packet coming in to the switch, flood it to all
ports, and let each connected host pick up what's meant for them (algorithm
\ref{algorithm:l2.hub}).

\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \On{Ethernet packet $e$}{port $p$}
      \State \textbf{flood} $p$ \Comment{Send packet out on \textit{all} ports}
    \EndOn
  \end{algorithmic}
  \label{algorithm:l2.hub}
  \caption{An L2 hub algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

A slightly better approach is to implement an L2 learning switch\footnote{L2
is the \textit{link--layer} in the OSI model.}.  The difference from the
flood--to--all hub above is that we create a table that maps
MAC--addresses to ports and then forward each packet to a single port.

As we build up this table we can install flow table entries so that the
switch will be able to forward packets by itself.

Algorithm
\ref{algorithm:l2.learning.switch}\vpageref{algorithm:l2.learning.switch} is
very simple.

\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \State $M \gets \emptyset$\Comment{Set containing $\langle
      \text{mac--address},\ port \rangle$--tuples}
    \State
    \On{Ethernet packet $e$}{port $p$}
      \State $m_{dst} \gets \text{destination MAC address in}\ e$
      \State $m_{src} \gets \text{source MAC address in}\ e$
      \State
      \State $M \gets M \cup \langle m_{src},\ p \rangle$ \Comment{Learn
        which port $m_{src}$ can be reached on}
      \State
      \State \textbf{add.flowtable.entry}(for ethernet packets to
        $m_{src}$, \textbf{forward} to port $p$)
      \State
      \If{$\langle m_{dst},\ \cdot\ \rangle \in M$} \Comment{Do we
          \textit{also} know the destination port?}
        \State \textbf{forward} $p$ \textbf{to} destination port for $m_{dst}$ in $M$
      \Else
        \State \textbf{flood} $p$ \Comment{Act as hub; send packet to all ports}
      \EndIf
    \EndOn
  \end{algorithmic}
  \label{algorithm:l2.learning.switch}
  \caption{Algorithm for an L2 learning switch.}
\end{algorithm}

As you can see, algorithm \ref{algorithm:l2.learning.switch} will need to
run at least twice before it will know both the source and destination ports
for two MAC--addresses.  If we send an \textit{\acs{ICMP} ping packet} from
host $a$ to $b$, the switch running the algorithm will first note which port
$a$ is on, and then flood the packet out all ports.

$b$ will then receive the packet\footnote{The other hosts' networking stack
will simply drop the packet, as it's not for them---unless their \acs{NIC} is
running in \textit{promiscuous mode}, capturing all packets.} and send an \acs{ICMP}
ping reply packet.  When this reaches the switch, it will learn which port
$b$ is on and can now do a packet forwarding instead of a flood.

We also make sure to install rules in the OpenFlow flow table, so that
subsequent packets to these two hosts will automatically be forwarded to the
respective port.  It means that the controller will not see those packets
anymore.  As mentioned elsewhere, each flow table entry has an associated
set of idle and hard timeout counters.  We've not indicated values for these
here, but typically one sets the idle timeout to 10 seconds and the hard
timeout to 60 seconds.  At the longest, we will need to add the rule again
after 60 seconds\footnote{This is to keep the flow table from going full.}.

Finally, one must realize that it doesn't matter if the ports are connected
\textit{directly} to hosts with the associated MAC--addresses.  Even if the
ports are links to other networks, we know that a MAC--address has been seen
coming from this port, and must therefore be reachable, somehow, on that
port.

This algorithm has been implemented in Python using the POX controller.
