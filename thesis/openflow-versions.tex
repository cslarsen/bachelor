\section{Features in OpenFlow versions 1.0--1.4}

To see how we can enable Paxos functionality in OpenFlow, we need to take a
look at what features it can provide us.

Naturally, we could implement the whole Paxos algorithm in the controller
itself.  Doing so should be quite trivial: One could take an existing
implementation and make some slight modifications to it.  There is in fact
some merit to this idea, because we could deploy systems where most of the
Paxos algorithm is implemented on the controllers, leaving some minor Paxos
code to run on the end--systems (for instance, the end--systems would need
to recognize Paxos LEARN--messages and extract the payload).

However, that would be very inefficient compared to running the entire
algorithm---or parts of it---on the switch.

OpenFlow controllers are meant to set up entries in the flow tables as they
see fit.  In an efficient OpenFlow--system, the
controllers will initially get lots of packets and program the flow tables.
Over time, more work can be performed by the use of flow tables, and so the
controllers will only update the flow tables intermittently.

The flow tables themselves will then be able to match given
packets to the specification and perform actions on them.  These flow tables
are {\em designed} to allow very efficient implementations in hardware.  In
other words, this means that the actions that can be performed are very
simple and far from a fully--fledged programmable system.

Because of this, we need to take a look at what operations we can perform in
OpenFlow.  The versions vary quite a bit on this point, and a lot of
software only support given versions.  So let's get an overview of what is
possible in the different OpenFlow versions.

\section{OpenFlow 1.0}

Prior to OpenFlow 1.0 \cite{openflow-1.0.0} there were several working
drafts not meant for implementation.  We will not look at these prior
versions.

In the tables below, you can see what version 1.0 offers in terms of core
functionality.  Some details have been omitted in favour of giving a clear
overview.  For details, see the full specification \cite{openflow-1.0.0}.

What's most important in 1.0, compared to later versions, is that it only
has {\em one} flow table.  Other than that it has counters per table, per
flow, per port and per queue.  The headers that can be used for
\textbf{matching packets} are listed in table
\ref{table:openflow-1.0.headers}, the \textbf{actions} in table
\ref{table:openflow-1.0.actions} and the {\em optional} \textbf{modifiable
fields} in table \ref{table:openflow-1.0.mods}

The specification requires compliant switches to update packet checksums
when modifying fields that require it.
