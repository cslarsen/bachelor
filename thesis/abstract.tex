\todo{Dette er bare et førsteutkast! Må forbedres.}

Sofware-defined networking (SDN) decouples the control plane from the
forwarding plane in switches, making it possible to create controllers in
software.

This has made it possible to build arbitrarily advanced networks, including
production networks that self-optimize for low power-consumption, cloud
networks that route live traffic to moving virtual machines as well as
making it possible to test out new networking protocols using simulators on
a laptop.

One SDN solution is OpenFlow, a specification that defines a protocol and
associated actions that can take place on a switch, programmed by a software
controller.

Scaling of networks require distributed computing, and distributed computing
requires resilience to faults.
%
The most cited paper on network resilience is the Paxos system for message
ordering.

We have implemented steady-phase Paxos on a software switch, making it
possible for controllers to compose flows that leverage the message ordering
guarantees of Paxos as a constituent element.
%
As a demonstration of its use, we have built a replication UDP-based system
where services are mirrored using Paxos transparently.

\todo{Konklusjon er ikke ferdig}

We conclude that the system shows promise and may be more efficient than
Paxos middleware software for certain network topologies.
%
While the system handles replication of UDP services, TCP may be harder to
support.
