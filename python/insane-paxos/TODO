In _send, if dest == self, then use getattr to find function and turn it
into a function call... not strictly needed, but would be nice.

Need pure clients that can send messages to the paxos system.

Need to turn this into an SDN controller.
  - set up links between all three switches (1->{2,3}; 2->3;)
  - the controller needs to function as a switch also, or else we won't be
  able to route packages
  - the controller implements paxos.. need to be able to see what kind of
  messages are paxos messages.
  - when this is done, we need a client to send commands and some servers that
  receive commands.. these will all receive commands in the same order
  (i.e., the commands contain unique sequence numbers, the servers will only
   process the next in sequence and buffer the next ones)
  - define a protobuf interface between client->paxos/switch and
  paxos/switch->servers
  - run at least two clients and first try to make a race condition.. now
  show that the paxos switches makes sure that everything runs in order..
  (use logging).. the best way may be to have the two clients in the same
  process, so we know the internal client ordering, then make sure that the
  output at the servers is consistent... or i dont think this is needed.. we
  only need to show that ALL the servers have the exact same ordering at all
  points (except for cases where one server is ahead on some messages)

stuff I disregard currently
- heartbeats
- leader election
